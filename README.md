## 2. Technical overview:
Step by step workflow from data exploration, processing to inference is defined clearly by Udacity team. We follow the workflow and try different approaches and ML algorithm and select the best model with good accuracy/F score.

Key questions answered in this notebook:
* Naive Predictor Performace
* Model Application
* Choosing the Best Model
* Describing the Model in Layman's Terms
* Final Model Evaluation
* Feature Relevance Observation
* Extracting Feature Importance
* Effects of Feature Selection
